# Welcome to the Microsoft Glossary

The "Microsoft Glossary" is an encyclopedia of words, expressions and abbreviations related to Microsoft technologies. It will be hosted on `docs.microsoft.com/glossary`. It helps visitors to find the definitions of words, expressions and abbreviations related to Microsoft technologies such as Azure, Microsoft 365 and more. It helps visitors getting started with a new technological topic by making it easy to understand the vocabulary. It also helps Microsoft documentation writers by providing a unique repository of topics that they can link to.
