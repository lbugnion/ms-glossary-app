- In [Another test topic](/topic/en/test_authentication), a topic used to for tests only.
- In [Azure Active Directory AAD](/topic/en/aad_authentication), a service used to provide identity services, such as authentication and authorization.
- In [Yet another test topic](/topic/en/another-test_authentication), another topic used to for tests only, that you should probably ignore.
