00:00:00,268 --> 00:00:03,125
Hello and welcome to Microsoft
Azure Words of the Day,

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,046
the show that teaches
you the Azure vocabulary!

3
00:00:07,411 --> 00:00:12,244
Today's words of the day are
abbreviations: TLS / SSL.

4
00:00:13,162 --> 00:00:16,862
TLS is short for
Transport Layer Security

5
00:00:16,952 --> 00:00:20,296
SSL is short for
Secure Sockets Layer.

6
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:25,594
SSL is a standard that enables secure,
encrypted transmissions over the internet.

7
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:29,664
It requires a certificate that you
can purchase from various vendors.

8
00:00:29,795 --> 00:00:34,667
TLS is similar to SSL but it is a
newer, more modern version.

9
00:00:34,797 --> 00:00:37,029
It also relies on certificates,

10
00:00:37,061 --> 00:00:42,507
in fact when you purchase an SSL certificate,
it is often already ready for TLS.

11
00:00:43,065 --> 00:00:46,648
When TLS or SSL are
setup on your web server,

12
00:00:46,727 --> 00:00:50,755
this enables you to serve
web content over HTTPS.

13
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:55,450
This other abbreviation means:
Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure.

14
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:58,299
But just like HTTP
is not just for text,

15
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,307
HTTPS is encrypting the
whole communication.

16
00:01:01,438 --> 00:01:07,202
HTTPS is often used in the web browser,
but it can also be used for APIs, etc.

17
00:01:07,789 --> 00:01:10,153
In the Azure portal,
you can easily buy

18
00:01:10,178 --> 00:01:13,578
or import a certificate to
secure your App Service.

19
00:01:13,682 --> 00:01:17,749
Note however that web applications
on Azure are secure by default.

20
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,085
This is why you see
HTTPS in the location bar

21
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:25,730
when you navigate to any website
on anything.azurewebsites.net,

22
00:01:25,784 --> 00:01:29,832
which is the default address for
App Services, Azure Functions, etc.

23
00:01:29,884 --> 00:01:34,735
The certificate and the HTTPS settings are
needed when you want to use a custom domain,

24
00:01:34,806 --> 00:01:36,711
for example TailwindTraders.com.

25
00:01:36,772 --> 00:01:39,223
When navigating
to an HTTPS site,

26
00:01:39,253 --> 00:01:42,447
you can see more information
about the certificate here.

27
00:01:42,499 --> 00:01:47,439
This shows a valid certificate used on
a custom domain, it's safe to browse it.

28
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:51,568
You can sometimes choose
between HTTP or HTTPS.

29
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:56,471
Here we see a note in the web browser
indicating that this connection is not secure.

30
00:01:56,691 --> 00:02:00,957
It is recommended to always require
HTTPS on your web application.

31
00:02:01,018 --> 00:02:03,975
In Azure, you can set it
up with this switch here.

32
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:06,040
Security is a complex topic,

33
00:02:06,065 --> 00:02:09,516
and we definitely need more than
just two minutes to talk about it.

34
00:02:09,572 --> 00:02:12,022
So check the links here
to learn more about that.

35
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:15,347
Thank you so much for watching
Microsoft Azure Words of the Day.

36
00:02:15,407 --> 00:02:19,068
Today's abbreviations of
the day were: TLS / SSL.
