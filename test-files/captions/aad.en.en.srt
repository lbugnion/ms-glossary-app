00:00:00,589 --> 00:00:03,413
Hello and welcome to Microsoft
Azure Words of the Day

2
00:00:03,438 --> 00:00:06,484
this is the show that teaches
you the Azure vocabulary!

3
00:00:06,801 --> 00:00:11,168
Today's word of the day
is an abbreviation: AAD

4
00:00:13,884 --> 00:00:17,033
AAD is short for Azure
Active Directory.

5
00:00:17,104 --> 00:00:21,239
It is a fundamental component of
Azure and it has to do with security,

6
00:00:21,264 --> 00:00:25,013
more specifically with identity
and access management.

7
00:00:25,265 --> 00:00:30,764
It's sometimes called IDaaS,
or Identity as a service.

8
00:00:30,977 --> 00:00:35,170
AAD has wide applications to
identify and authorize people,

9
00:00:35,195 --> 00:00:39,306
inside Azure of course but also
inside your own organization.

10
00:00:39,425 --> 00:00:42,652
It can also be used to manage
the identity of your users

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,933
for third party
cloud applications,

12
00:00:45,028 --> 00:00:47,860
or even to manage the
identity of your customers.

13
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:50,479
There are different
editions of AAD,

14
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,490
Free, Basic and Premium.

15
00:00:53,697 --> 00:00:58,606
Each edition has specific features, so
make sure to check the documentation here.

16
00:00:58,631 --> 00:01:01,847
You can integrate with
AAD at multiple levels:

17
00:01:01,872 --> 00:01:03,686
In the Microsoft cloud,

18
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:08,615
with Microsoft 365 or any of our
Platform as a Service offerings.

19
00:01:08,772 --> 00:01:12,571
In Windows 10 to join a
device to an organization, etc.

20
00:01:12,753 --> 00:01:18,206
It can also handle single
sign-on, B2C, B2B and more.

21
00:01:18,348 --> 00:01:22,073
It's easy to use multi-factor
authentication with AAD.

22
00:01:22,098 --> 00:01:25,660
For example by using the
Microsoft Authenticator app,

23
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:28,018
this is how I can use my
fingerprint to confirm

24
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,505
that I want to log into
a Microsoft domain,

25
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:32,429
for example the Azure Portal.

26
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,736
Of course this also works for a wide
range of sites and applications.

27
00:01:37,106 --> 00:01:39,843
Azure Active Directory has
a lot of great features

28
00:01:39,942 --> 00:01:43,820
and it makes setting up identity services
much easier than it used to be.

29
00:01:43,928 --> 00:01:47,247
So make sure to check all the
links that we assembled for you here!

30
00:01:47,383 --> 00:01:50,676
Thank you so much for watching
Microsoft Azure Words of the Day.

31
00:01:50,706 --> 00:01:53,802
Today's word of
the day was: AAD.
